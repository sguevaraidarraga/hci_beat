# Sampling Music Project – Interaction Systems Workshop 1

## Team Members
- Santiago Guevara Idárraga

## Description
This repository delivers an **"original" 30-second beat** produced in **Audacity** using **sampling techniques** from **three distinct sources**. The objective was to integrate heterogeneous sonic textures into a cohesive micro-composition.

## Methodology
Key fragments from each source were trimmed, time-stretched, pitch-shifted, and EQ-balanced in Audacity. Layers were aligned to a common tempo grid, with fades and light reverb to ensure seamless transitions and mix coherence.
